## Project Overview

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
4. Create a story using the visualizations created.

## Challenge Summary
It appears that the majority of Citibike riders in NYC are subscribers who are using the bikes as transportation to and from work.

One visualization that would be helpful to see is the distance traveled during peak hours by subscribers.  Another would be the top starting and stopping location for non-subscriber customers only.
